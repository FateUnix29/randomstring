# Random Vector
Just a random project. (Get it?)

Uses the 'rand' library to generate a vector of randomized numbers and ordered length, as well as a few other helpful utilities such as an odd sorting mechanism (possibly)

Somewhat a test to see how the --vcs=git flag works, because I never use version control for my Rust crates.
